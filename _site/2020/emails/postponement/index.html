<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>As you may have seen on our website or from Tiare's posts on social media, we've had to make the disappointing decision to postpone our wedding until next year.</p>
<p>While were were optimistic, at the time we sent out our invitations, that we would be able to hold the wedding on our original scheduled date, it now appears that Seattle will not be ready to allow gatherings of 100 people by then, and even if it were, we would not be comfortable asking our many cross-country guests with at-risk family to travel before a vaccine for COVID-19 is available.</p>
<p>We're excited about our plans for the rescheduled date, though: all the vendors we were hoping to have this year (including both of our hotel blocks, at Moxy and The Westin) have agreed to our new date, and now we have another year to work and refine our plan to throw the best wedding we could possibly have.</p>
<p>With that being said, we ask that our guests block out <strong>July 10, 2021</strong> for our new wedding date!</p>
<p>xoxo,
Stuart + Tiare</p>
