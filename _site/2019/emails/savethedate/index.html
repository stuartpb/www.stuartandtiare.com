<hr>
<p>If you haven't heard yet: we're getting married! It's still about a year away, but we're sending this email out now so our far-flung family can have sufficient time to make travel arrangements.</p>
<p>We're still gathering contact information, so if you want to make sure you get the paper correspondence we'll be sending out later this year, please <strong>reply to this email with your current mailing address</strong> and the names of family in your household, or fill out the form on our website linked below.</p>
<p>Also, getting these emails to look right is pretty tricky: if you'd like to be in the test group for future correspondence (potentially getting several broken copies of the same message before we get it right), let us know, and we'll add you to our release-testing group. (If you're reading this plain-text version, you're probably using an email system we need to be testing against.)</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Tiare and Stuart (the Bride and Gride)</p>
