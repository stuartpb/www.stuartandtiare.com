# Stuart and Tiare are getting married! #

## July 11, 2020 - Seattle, WA ##

(Apologies for the double-email: I forgot to save the new version, and didn't do a test run first. Oof!)

We have just under six months to go until, and we're so excited to see you all! We're sending out another wave of Save the Date emails to make sure everybody's got it in their calendar (this time in plain text, in case anybody had trouble reading the fancy one from last summer).

We'll be sending out our wedding invitations in the mail next month, so if you didn't receive a Christmas card from us this past December, please make sure you **reply to this email** and make sure we have a current address for you in our records.

Yours sincerely,

Tiare and Stuart
