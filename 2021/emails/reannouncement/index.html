<p>As we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel with COVID-19 and people are starting to make summer plans, we wanted to let everyone know that we're going forward with the plan we announced last June to hold our wedding on July 10, 2021.</p>
<p>We're hoping all our guests will be vaccinated to full immunity by then, and that people will feel safe travelling out to Seattle. We have group rates lined up for two hotels on the Friday and Saturday of the wedding (let us know if you will be coming out for longer than that, and we can arrange longer reservations with the hotel at the group rate).</p>
<p>For most of our guests, we recommend reserving a room at Moxy Seattle Downtown, which is stylish, affordable, and about two blocks from the park where the boat will be docked: https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1617398225294&amp;key=GRP&amp;app=resvlink</p>
<p>For our guests who would like a more luxurious stay, The Westin Seattle is a four-star hotel with a straight one-mile ride, via the South Lake Union Trolley, direct to Lake Union Park (you can also take a cab or walk): https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1615933227476&amp;key=GRP&amp;app=resvlink</p>
<p>For flights, guests can fly in to SeaTac International Airport, then take the Light Link Rail to Westlake Station, which opens up right next to the Westin. From there, guests staying at Moxy can get there by taking the Streetcar (affectionately known to locals as the South Lake Union Trolley). You can also use Uber/Lyft.</p>
<p>As the day approaches, you'll be able to find more information at https://www.StuartAndTiare.com/ - we hope to see you in July!</p>
